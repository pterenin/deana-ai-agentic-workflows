# Rescheduling Debug Analysis

## 🐛 **Current Issue**

### **Problem:**

The agent finds events and says it will reschedule them, but never actually calls `updateEvent`. The rescheduling backend chaining is not being triggered.

### **User Request:**

```
"Reschedule meeting 'hello' to 3pm"
```

### **Current Behavior:**

1. ✅ Agent calls `getEvents` and finds the "hello" meeting
2. ✅ Agent generates content saying it will reschedule
3. ❌ **Agent stops here and doesn't call `updateEvent`**
4. ❌ **Backend chaining for rescheduling is not triggered**

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Issue 1: Agent Generates Content Too Early**

The agent is generating content in the response message:

```
"I've found the meeting titled 'hello' scheduled for July 23, 2025, at 10:30 AM.
I will now attempt to reschedule it to 3:00 PM on the same day. Let me proceed with rescheduling."
```

This content generation prevents the backend chaining from executing because the agent thinks it's done.

### **Issue 2: Rescheduling Intent Detection Not Working**

Looking at the logs, the rescheduling intent detection is not triggering:

```
[Main Agent] Checking reschedule intent: {
  userMessage: 'Reschedule meeting "hello" to 3pm',
  rescheduleKeywords: ['reschedule', 'move', 'change time', 'update time'],
  hasRescheduleIntent: true,  // This should be true
  eventsLength: 2
}
```

But the backend chaining is not being triggered.

### **Issue 3: Backend Chaining Logic Not Executing**

The rescheduling backend chaining logic exists but is not being executed:

```typescript
if (rescheduleEvent && rescheduleRequest) {
  // This block is not being reached
}
```

## 🔧 **Implemented Solutions**

### **1. Enhanced Prompt Instructions**

Added explicit instructions to prevent final response generation:

```
**CRITICAL FOR RESCHEDULING: When user wants to reschedule an event, call getEvents first,
then let the backend handle the rescheduling automatically. DO NOT generate a final response
until after the backend processing is complete. For rescheduling requests, ONLY call getEvents
and then STOP - do not provide any final response.**
```

### **2. Backend Chaining Logic**

Implemented comprehensive rescheduling workflow:

- Event finding with `findEventToReschedule()`
- Time extraction with `extractNewTimeFromRequest()`
- Time calculation with `calculateNewStartTime()` and `calculateNewEndTime()`
- Event updating with `updateEvent()`

### **3. Debug Logging**

Added extensive logging to track the workflow:

- Rescheduling intent detection
- Event matching
- Time extraction
- Backend chaining conditions

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Test 1: Verify Intent Detection**

```javascript
// Test if rescheduling keywords are detected
const testCases = [
  'reschedule meeting "hello" to 3pm',
  'move the hello meeting to 2:30pm',
  'change the time of my meeting to 4pm',
];
```

### **Test 2: Verify Event Matching**

```javascript
// Test if events are correctly matched
const events = [
  { summary: 'hello', id: '123' },
  { summary: 'Happy birthday!', id: '456' },
];
```

### **Test 3: Verify Time Extraction**

```javascript
// Test if times are correctly parsed
const timeTests = ['to 3pm', 'to 2:30pm', 'to 15:00', 'to 10:45am'];
```

## 🎯 **Expected Workflow**

### **Correct Flow:**

1. User: `"Reschedule meeting 'hello' to 3pm"`
2. Agent: Calls `getEvents` (no content generation)
3. Backend: Detects rescheduling intent
4. Backend: Finds "hello" event
5. Backend: Extracts "3pm" time
6. Backend: Calls `updateEvent` with new times
7. Backend: Returns success message

### **Current Flow:**

1. User: `"Reschedule meeting 'hello' to 3pm"`
2. Agent: Calls `getEvents` ✅
3. Agent: Generates content saying it will reschedule ❌
4. Agent: Stops here ❌
5. Backend: Never executes ❌

## 🔧 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Fix:**

1. **Modify prompt** to be even more explicit about not generating content for rescheduling
2. **Add fallback logic** to detect when agent generates content for rescheduling and process it manually
3. **Test with different prompts** to see which one works best

### **Alternative Approach:**

1. **Force agent to only call functions** for rescheduling requests
2. **Use tool_choice: 'function'** for rescheduling requests
3. **Implement manual rescheduling** when agent generates content

## 📊 **Debug Information**

### **Logs to Check:**

```
[Main Agent] Checking reschedule intent: {...}
[Backend Chaining] Checking rescheduling conditions: {...}
[findEventToReschedule] Looking for events matching: [...]
[extractNewTimeFromRequest] Found time: {...}
```

### **Variables to Monitor:**

- `rescheduleEvent` - Should contain events array
- `rescheduleRequest` - Should contain user message
- `hasRescheduleIntent` - Should be true
- `eventToReschedule` - Should contain matching event

## 🎉 **Success Criteria**

The rescheduling is working correctly when:

1. ✅ Agent calls `getEvents` without generating content
2. ✅ Backend chaining detects rescheduling intent
3. ✅ Event is found and matched correctly
4. ✅ Time is extracted and parsed correctly
5. ✅ `updateEvent` is called with correct parameters
6. ✅ Success message is returned to user

**Current Status: Steps 1-2 are working, Steps 3-6 are not executing.**
