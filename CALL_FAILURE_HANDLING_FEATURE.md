# Call Failure Handling Feature

## üõ°Ô∏è **Feature Overview**

This feature adds robust validation to detect when phone calls fail during appointment booking and prevents calendar events from being created inappropriately. It provides clear error messaging to users when booking attempts are unsuccessful.

### **Problem Solved:**

- Phone call fails (no answer, busy, disconnected)
- System previously would still attempt to create calendar events
- Users received no clear explanation of what went wrong
- System now detects failures and provides professional error handling

---

## üîß **Implementation Details**

### **1. Call Validation Logic**

**Location**: `src/agents/bookAppointmentAgent.ts`

```javascript
function validateCallSuccess(
  callData: any,
  transcript: string
): { success: boolean, message: string } {
  // Check if call ended successfully
  if (callData?.status !== 'ended') {
    return {
      success: false,
      message: `Call failed - status: ${callData?.status || 'unknown'}`,
    };
  }

  // Check for call failure reasons
  const endedReason = callData?.endedReason;
  const customerNumber = callData?.customer?.number || 'unknown number';

  if (
    endedReason === 'no-answer' ||
    endedReason === 'busy' ||
    endedReason === 'failed'
  ) {
    return {
      success: false,
      message: `There was a problem booking the appointment. The number ${customerNumber} did not answer or the call failed.`,
    };
  }

  // Additional validation checks...
}
```

### **2. Validation Scenarios Covered**

**Call Status Issues:**

- ‚úÖ Call status ‚â† 'ended'
- ‚úÖ Call ended due to 'no-answer'
- ‚úÖ Call ended due to 'busy'
- ‚úÖ Call ended due to 'failed'

**Content Quality Issues:**

- ‚úÖ No transcript or very short transcript (< 10 characters)
- ‚úÖ No summary provided by call processing
- ‚úÖ Customer ended call prematurely (< 20 characters)

**Business Response Issues:**

- ‚úÖ Business explicitly declined ("sorry", "cannot", "unable")
- ‚úÖ Business indicates closure ("closed", "not available")
- ‚úÖ Business is fully booked ("no appointments", "fully booked")

### **3. Integration with Booking Flow**

**Location**: `src/agents/bookAppointmentAgent.ts`

```javascript
// 4. Validate call success before creating calendar event
const callValidation = validateCallSuccess(poll.data, transcript);

if (!callValidation.success) {
  console.log('[bookAppointmentAgent] Call validation failed:', callValidation);

  onProgress?.({
    type: 'error',
    content: `Failed to book appointment: ${callValidation.message}`,
  });

  return {
    error: true,
    message: callValidation.message,
    appointment: null,
    transcript,
    callDetails: poll.data,
  };
}

// Only proceed to calendar creation if call was successful
if (/confirm|booked|scheduled|appointment is set|yes/i.test(transcript)) {
  // Create calendar event...
}
```

## üéØ **User Experience Flow**

### **Before Feature (Problematic):**

```
üë§ User: "Book appointment today at 6pm"
üìû Call: No answer / Busy / Disconnected
ü§ñ System: Attempts to parse transcript anyway
üìÖ Calendar: May create event based on incomplete data
ü§ñ Response: "Your appointment has been booked..." (misleading!)
üòû User: "But nobody answered the phone!"
```

### **After Feature (Professional):**

```
üë§ User: "Book appointment today at 6pm"
üìû Call: No answer / Busy / Disconnected
ü§ñ System: Detects call failure immediately
üìÖ Calendar: NO event created (protected!)
ü§ñ Response: "There was a problem booking the appointment. The number +16049108101 did not answer or got disconnected."
üòä User: "Thanks for letting me know. I'll try again later."
```

## üß™ **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test Case 1: No Answer**

```
Input: "Book appointment today at 6pm"
Call Result: { status: 'ended', endedReason: 'no-answer' }
Expected: Error message with phone number, no calendar event
```

### **Test Case 2: Customer Hung Up Early**

```
Input: "Book appointment today at 6pm"
Call Result: { status: 'ended', endedReason: 'customer-ended-call', transcript: "Hello?" }
Expected: Error about disconnection, no calendar event
```

### **Test Case 3: Business Declined**

```
Input: "Book appointment today at 6pm"
Call Result: { status: 'ended', transcript: "Sorry, we're closed today" }
Expected: Error about business availability, no calendar event
```

### **Test Case 4: No Summary Generated**

```
Input: "Book appointment today at 6pm"
Call Result: { status: 'ended', summary: null, transcript: "..." }
Expected: Error about connection issues, no calendar event
```

### **Test Command:**

```bash
node test-call-failure-handling.js
```

## üîç **Error Message Templates**

### **No Answer / Call Failed:**

```
"There was a problem booking the appointment. The number {PHONE_NUMBER} did not answer or the call failed."
```

### **Disconnected During Call:**

```
"There was a problem booking the appointment. The number {PHONE_NUMBER} got disconnected before completing the booking."
```

### **Business Unavailable:**

```
"The appointment could not be booked. The business {PHONE_NUMBER} indicated they are not available or fully booked."
```

### **Technical Issues:**

```
"There was a problem booking the appointment. The number {PHONE_NUMBER} did not answer or got disconnected."
```

## üîç **Debug Information**

### **Console Logs Added:**

```javascript
console.log('[validateCallSuccess] Validating call:', {
  status: callData?.status,
  endedReason: callData?.endedReason,
  summary: callData?.summary || 'No summary',
  transcriptLength: transcript?.length || 0,
  customerNumber: callData?.customer?.number,
});
```

### **Debug Validation:**

```
‚úÖ "[validateCallSuccess] Validating call: { status: 'ended', endedReason: 'no-answer' }"
‚úÖ "[bookAppointmentAgent] Call validation failed: { success: false, message: '...' }"
‚úÖ "Failed to book appointment: There was a problem..."
‚ùå Should NOT see: "Creating calendar event..."
‚ùå Should NOT see: Calendar API calls in logs
```
