## Agent Autonomy Recommendations

Short answer: your current OpenAI SDK-based approach is solid; reduce over-programming and give the model clearer authority to plan and act, while keeping code-level safety rails.

### What to change now (low effort, high impact)

- **Add a planner step**

  - First have the model output a short, structured plan: tools to call, args, order, and success criteria.
  - Execute the plan; then a quick reflect step: “did we achieve the goal?” If not, one retry or ask a targeted question.

- **Loosen guardrails; keep vetoes**

  - Move decision rules (e.g., when to reschedule, which calendar) into the system prompt/policy with examples.
  - Keep code-level vetoes only for unsafe/irreversible actions or missing data; otherwise allow model-initiated actions.

- **Define autonomy policy in the prompt**

  - Allow proceeding without re-asking if confidence is high and inputs are sufficient.
  - Require an internal rationale (plan/why-this-tool) but don’t surface it to the user.

- **Strengthen tool schemas**

  - Accept partial args; resolve IDs/ambiguity in handlers (you already started doing this for events and contacts).
  - Include “success signals” in tool results (e.g., `updatedEvent { id, start, end }`) so the model knows when to stop vs. retry.

- **Maintain working memory in context**

  - Persist artifacts like `conflictDetails`, `rescheduleContext`, `lastCreatedEvent` and inject them into subsequent turns.
  - This reduces re-asking and enables follow-on actions (e.g., calling with event context, continuing reschedules).

- **Add reflect-and-retry micro-loop**

  - If a tool returns `error` or lacks required success fields, attempt one automatic correction (args tweak, fallback search) before asking the user.

- **Observability (keep it lightweight)**
  - Keep progress logs; add a compact “plan → act → reflect” trace per step for debugging and evaluation.

### Example flow shape (without new frameworks)

1. system: autonomy policy + tools + examples
2. assistant: PLAN {steps, tools, args, success criteria}
3. tool calls per plan (with context memory)
4. assistant: REFLECT {success?, next_step?} → finish or single retry

### When to consider LangGraph (optional)

Adopt a framework if you need:

- Complex, branching, resumable workflows with human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- Durable state beyond in-memory session maps
- Built-in observability/telemetry and graph visualization
- Multiple cooperating agents with clearer orchestration

If you don’t need the above, the SDK + changes here provide an “agentic” feel with less complexity and migration cost.

### Migration strategy if you pilot LangGraph

- Pilot on a single contained flow (e.g., rescheduling).
- Model the existing handlers as nodes; reuse your tools and context memory.
- Keep the current SDK path for everything else until the pilot demonstrates value (maintain dual-run or feature flag).

### Quick checklist

- [ ] Add planner + reflector steps to the loop
- [ ] Move most decision logic to the prompt; keep only safety vetoes in code
- [ ] Expand tool schemas to accept partial args and emit success signals
- [ ] Persist and reuse working memory (conflicts, last event, alternatives)
- [ ] Add a single retry with adjusted args before asking the user
- [ ] Keep concise plan/act/reflect traces for debugging

This set of changes increases autonomy while preserving your safety and reliability guarantees.
