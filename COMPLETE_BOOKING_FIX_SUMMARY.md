# Complete Booking Fix Summary

## 🚨 **Issues Fixed**

This document summarizes the **two critical issues** that were identified and resolved in the booking system:

### **Issue #1: Date Parsing Problem**

- **Problem**: User says "today" but system checks "tomorrow"
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

### **Issue #2: Time Mismatch Problem**

- **Problem**: AI says "8 PM" but calendar event created at "6 PM"
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

## 🔧 **Issue #1: Date Parsing Fix**

### **Problem Details:**

```
👤 User: "book appointment today at 6pm"
🤖 System: "Checking availability for hair on 7/26/2025" (tomorrow!)
📅 Expected: Should check 7/25/2025 (today!)
```

### **Root Cause:**

In `src/agents/bookAppointmentAgent.ts`, faulty logic prioritized **tomorrow** over **today**:

```javascript
// WRONG: Check tomorrow FIRST, then today, then default to tomorrow
const date = tomorrow
  ? getTomorrowDate()
  : today
  ? new Date()
  : getTomorrowDate(); // ← Default was tomorrow!
```

### **Fix Applied:**

✅ **Fixed priority logic** to check **today first**, then tomorrow, then default to **today**:

```javascript
// CORRECT: Check TODAY first, then tomorrow, then default to today
const date = today
  ? new Date() // TODAY - current date
  : tomorrow
  ? getTomorrowDate() // TOMORROW - next day
  : new Date(); // DEFAULT to TODAY, not tomorrow

console.log('[extractAppointmentDetails] Date parsing:', {
  userRequest,
  today,
  tomorrow,
  todayMatch: userRequest.match(/today|now/i),
  tomorrowMatch: userRequest.match(/tomm?orr?ow|next day/i),
});
```

### **Expected Behavior After Fix:**

```
👤 User: "book appointment today at 6pm"
🔍 Debug: "[extractAppointmentDetails] Date parsing: today: true"
🤖 System: "Checking availability for hair on 7/25/2025" ✅
📅 Calendar: Event created for July 25th ✅
```

---

## 🔧 **Issue #2: Time Mismatch Fix**

### **Problem Details:**

```
👤 User: "book appointment today at 6pm"
📞 Phone Call: Business confirms "8 PM with Tom"
🤖 AI Response: "booked for today at 8 PM" ✅ (correct)
📅 Calendar Event: 2025-07-25T18:00:00 (6 PM) ❌ (wrong!)
```

### **Root Cause:**

In `src/agents/bookAppointmentAgent.ts`, calendar event was created using **original requested time** instead of **actual confirmed time** from phone transcript:

```javascript
// WRONG: Using original requested time
await createEvent(creds, calendarId, {
  start: startISO, // ← This was 18:00 (6 PM) from original request
  end: endISO, // ← This was 19:00 (7 PM) from original request
  summary: `${details.service} appointment`,
});
```

### **Fix Applied:**

✅ **Added transcript parsing** to extract **actual confirmed time** and use it for calendar event:

```javascript
// CORRECT: Parse actual confirmed time from transcript
const actualTime = parseActualTimeFromTranscript(transcript);
let actualStartISO = startISO; // Default to original if parsing fails
let actualEndISO = endISO;

if (actualTime) {
  console.log(
    '[bookAppointmentAgent] Original requested time:',
    details.start_time
  );
  console.log(
    '[bookAppointmentAgent] Actual confirmed time from transcript:',
    actualTime
  );

  // Create new ISO strings with the actual confirmed time
  actualStartISO = `${details.date}T${actualTime}:00-07:00`;
  const actualEndHour = String(parseInt(actualTime.split(':')[0]) + 1).padStart(
    2,
    '0'
  );
  const actualEndMinute = actualTime.split(':')[1];
  actualEndISO = `${details.date}T${actualEndHour}:${actualEndMinute}:00-07:00`;
}

await createEvent(creds, calendarId, {
  start: actualStartISO, // ← Now uses 20:00 (8 PM) from transcript
  end: actualEndISO, // ← Now uses 21:00 (9 PM) from transcript
  summary: `${details.service} appointment`,
});
```

### **New Helper Function:**

✅ **Added `parseActualTimeFromTranscript()`** with robust regex patterns:

```javascript
function parseActualTimeFromTranscript(transcript: string): string | null {
  const timePatterns = [
    /confirmed.*?(?:for|at|on).*?(\d{1,2})\s*(?:o'clock|PM|AM)/gi,
    /appointment.*?(?:confirmed|finalized|booked|set).*?(?:for|at|on).*?(\d{1,2})\s*(?:o'clock|PM|AM)/gi,
    /(?:at|for)\s*(\d{1,2})\s*(?:PM|AM).*?(?:with|Tom|stylist)/gi,
    /(\d{1,2})\s*(?:PM|AM).*?(?:confirmed|Tom|stylist|available)/gi,
    // ... more patterns
  ];

  // Extract all time matches and return the final confirmed time
  // Returns in 24-hour format (e.g., "20:00" for 8 PM)
}
```

### **Expected Behavior After Fix:**

```
👤 User: "book appointment today at 6pm"
📞 Phone Call: Confirms "8 PM with Tom"
🔍 Debug: "Original requested time: 18:00"
🔍 Debug: "Actual confirmed time from transcript: 20:00"
🤖 AI Response: "booked for today at 8 PM" ✅
📅 Calendar Event: 2025-07-25T20:00:00 (8 PM) ✅
🎯 Result: AI message and calendar event match perfectly!
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Complete Fix**

### **Test Command:**

```bash
node test-complete-booking-fix.js
```

### **Expected Success Indicators:**

```
✅ "[extractAppointmentDetails] Date parsing: today: true"
✅ "Checking calendar availability for hair on 7/25/2025"
✅ "Original requested time: 18:00"
✅ "Actual confirmed time from transcript: 20:00"
✅ "start: 2025-07-25T20:00:00" (calendar event at 8 PM)
✅ AI response mentions "8 PM"
✅ AI message time matches calendar event time
```

### **Failure Indicators (Should NOT See):**

```
❌ "today: false" when user said "today"
❌ "Checking availability for hair on 7/26/2025" (tomorrow)
❌ Calendar event shows T18:00:00 instead of T20:00:00
❌ AI says "8 PM" but calendar shows 6 PM
```

🤖 Response: "booked for today at 8 PM"
📅 Calendar: Event created for today at 8 PM (perfect!)
😊 User: "Exactly what I wanted!"
```
