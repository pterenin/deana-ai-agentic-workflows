# Deletion Issue Fix Summary

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**

The agent said it found "meeting with Vlada" but didn't actually delete it. The problem was:

1. **Agent didn't call `deleteEvent` function** - It found the event but didn't execute the deletion
2. **Missing workflow instructions** - Agent didn't know to get events first, then delete
3. **No yesterday support** - Agent couldn't handle "yesterday's meeting" requests
4. **Insufficient logging** - Couldn't see what was happening during the process

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Enhanced Agent Prompt** (`src/agents/prompts/mainAgentPrompt.ts`)

**Added Deletion Workflow:**

```
**DELETION WORKFLOW:**
1. When user wants to delete an event by name, FIRST call getEvents to find the event ID
2. Look for the event with the matching summary/title in the getEvents results
3. Use the event ID from the getEvents result to call deleteEvent
4. If multiple events match the name, ask user to be more specific
5. If no events match the name, inform the user
```

**Added Yesterday Support:**

```
**YESTERDAY'S EVENTS:**
- When user mentions "yesterday's meeting" or "yesterday", use getEvents with yesterday's date range
- Yesterday = (current date - 1 day) at 00:00:00 to 23:59:59
- Example: User: "delete yesterday's meeting with Vlada" → Agent: getEvents for yesterday, find "meeting with Vlada", then deleteEvent
```

**Updated Examples:**

- Changed from hardcoded event IDs to workflow instructions
- Added specific example for "meeting with Vlada"

### **2. Enhanced Date Context** (`src/agents/utils/dateUtils.ts`)

**Added Yesterday Support:**

```typescript
return {
  today: todayStr,
  tomorrow: tomorrowStr,
  yesterday: yesterdayStr, // NEW
  currentTime: now.toISOString(),
};
```

**Updated Prompt with Yesterday:**

```
CURRENT DATE CONTEXT:
- Today: ${dateContext.today}
- Tomorrow: ${dateContext.tomorrow}
- Yesterday: ${dateContext.yesterday}  // NEW
- Current time: ${dateContext.currentTime}
```

### **3. Enhanced Logging** (`src/agents/mainAgent.ts`)

**Added Function Call Tracking:**

```typescript
console.log(`[Main Agent] Found handler for ${functionName}, executing...`);
console.log(`[Main Agent] Function ${functionName} result:`, result);
```

**Added Error Detection:**

```typescript
} else {
  console.error(`[Main Agent] No handler found for function: ${functionName}`);
}
```

### **4. Enhanced Calendar Handler Logging** (`src/agents/handlers/calendarHandlers.ts`)

**Added Detailed Deletion Logging:**

```typescript
console.log('[Calendar Handler] deleteEvent called with args:', args);
console.log('[Calendar Handler] About to call deleteEvent function with:', {
  creds: creds ? 'present' : 'missing',
  calendarId: args.calendarId || 'tps8327@gmail.com',
  eventId: args.eventId,
});
console.log('[Calendar Handler] deleteEvent function returned:', result);
```

## 🔄 **Expected Workflow Now**

### **User Request:**

```
"please remove yesterdays meeting 'meeting with Vlada'"
```

### **Agent Actions:**

1. **Get Events for Yesterday:**

   ```typescript
   getEvents({
     timeMin: '2025-07-19T00:00:00-07:00',
     timeMax: '2025-07-19T23:59:59-07:00',
   });
   ```

2. **Find Matching Event:**

   ```typescript
   // Look for event with summary containing "vlada"
   const vladaMeeting = events.find((event) =>
     event.summary.toLowerCase().includes('vlada')
   );
   ```

3. **Delete the Event:**
   ```typescript
   deleteEvent({
     eventId: vladaMeeting.id,
     calendarId: 'tps8327@gmail.com',
   });
   ```

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test Scripts Created:**

- `test-deletion-workflow-real.js` - Simulates the real workflow
- Enhanced logging in all handlers

### **Manual Testing:**

```bash
# Start server
npm run dev

# Test the deletion
curl -X POST http://localhost:3060/api/chat/stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "please remove yesterdays meeting meeting with Vlada"}'
```

## 📊 **Expected Logs**

With the enhanced logging, you should now see:

```
[Main Agent] Calling function: getEvents
[Main Agent] Found handler for getEvents, executing...
[Calendar Handler] getEvents called with args: {...}
[Main Agent] Function getEvents result: {...}

[Main Agent] Calling function: deleteEvent
[Main Agent] Found handler for deleteEvent, executing...
[Calendar Handler] deleteEvent called with args: {...}
[Calendar Handler] About to call deleteEvent function with: {...}
[Calendar Handler] deleteEvent function returned: {...}
[Main Agent] Function deleteEvent result: {...}
```

## 🎯 **Benefits**

### **For Users:**

- **Natural language deletion**: "delete yesterday's meeting with Vlada"
- **Clear feedback**: Progress updates and confirmation
- **Error handling**: Clear messages if event not found

### **For Developers:**

- **Comprehensive logging**: See exactly what's happening
- **Workflow clarity**: Step-by-step deletion process
- **Error detection**: Identify missing handlers or failed calls

### **For System:**

- **Reliable deletion**: Proper workflow with validation
- **Date support**: Yesterday, today, tomorrow all supported
- **Robust error handling**: Graceful failure with clear messages

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the fixes** with the real server
2. **Monitor logs** to see the deletion workflow in action
3. **Verify deletion** actually happens
4. **Test edge cases** like multiple matching events

The deletion workflow should now work correctly! 🎉
